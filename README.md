# Swiggy Restaurant Recommendation System

This project is a restaurant recommendation system built using Python and Streamlit, aimed at helping users discover restaurants based on preferences such as city, cuisine, rating, and cost. The system processes real-world restaurant data, applies machine learning techniques, and presents recommendations through an interactive web application.


## Problem Statement

With thousands of restaurants available across multiple cities, users often struggle to choose the right option. This project addresses that challenge by building a personalized recommendation engine that suggests relevant restaurants based on user-defined criteria, improving decision-making and user experience.
## Technologies & Skills Used

. Programming Language: Python

. Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Pickle

Techniques:

    . Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

    . One-Hot Encoding

    . Clustering / Similarity-Based Recommendation   (K-Means, Cosine Similarity)

. Domain: Recommendation Systems & Data Analytics
## Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates and handle missing values.

2. Preprocessing: Encode categorical features (city, cuisine) using One-Hot Encoding.

3. Modeling: Apply clustering or similarity-based methods to identify similar restaurants.

4. Mapping Results: Map model outputs back to readable restaurant information.

5. Streamlit App: Build an interactive UI for user input and recommendation display.
## Features

. Interactive user inputs (city, cuisine, rating, cost)

. Personalized restaurant recommendations

. Clean and user-friendly Streamlit interface

. Scalable design for large datasets

. Reusable encoded data and model files (.pkl)
